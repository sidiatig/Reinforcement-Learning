# Reinforcement-Learning
Description: Reinforcement learning tutorials based on Sutton and Barto's book. 

This repo contains a series of notebooks aimed at learning Reinforcement Learning through the book by Sutton and Barto: http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html. It is meant to be a complement to each chapter, rather than a complete substitute.

However, I will try to make it as self-contained as possible, and keep the notations consistent with the book.

Contents (consistently updated):
- Chapter 2: K-armed bandit, exploration vs. exploitation, Gradient ascent algorithm
